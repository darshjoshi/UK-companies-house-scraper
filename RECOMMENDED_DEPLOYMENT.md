# 🎯 RECOMMENDED DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## ❌ Why Netlify is NOT ideal for your project:

1. **Complex Backend Logic**: Your app has sophisticated scraping, AI analysis, and multi-page processing
2. **Long-Running Processes**: Scraping can take 30+ seconds, Netlify functions timeout at 10 seconds (free) / 15 minutes (pro)
3. **Heavy Dependencies**: Stagehand, Puppeteer, and browser automation don't work well in serverless
4. **File Structure Issues**: Your modular TypeScript structure needs proper bundling for serverless

## ✅ BEST SOLUTION: Railway (5-minute setup)

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Select your repository: `UK-companies-house-scraper`
4. Railway automatically detects Node.js and uses your existing `package.json`

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, add:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Deploy
- Railway automatically runs `npm start`
- Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- No code changes needed!

## 🚀 Alternative: Render.com

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Node Version**: 18
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

## 🔧 If you MUST use Netlify (Not Recommended)

You would need to:
1. Completely restructure the app for serverless
2. Bundle all dependencies properly
3. Handle timeout limitations
4. Rewrite the scraping logic for serverless constraints

**This would require significant refactoring and isn't worth it.**

## 💡 Why Railway/Render Work Perfectly:

✅ **No Code Changes**: Your existing Express server works as-is
✅ **No Timeout Issues**: Can handle long-running scraping processes  
✅ **Full Node.js Support**: All your dependencies work perfectly
✅ **Easy Environment Variables**: Simple dashboard configuration
✅ **Automatic Deployments**: Connected to your GitHub
✅ **Free Tiers Available**: Great for testing

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: 
**Delete the Netlify files and deploy to Railway instead. It will work perfectly with zero code changes.**
